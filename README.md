# diysegway

We want to design a (rather) low cost self built segway. Therefore we assume to have 

- an Ardunio basis (ESP8266) for controlling. 
- gyroscope sensor and gravity meassurement sensor for handling the hover power
- weight-meassuring cells for controlling left and right turns while driving

This project is a personal science project and there is no warrenty for using any of the parts in this repository.
